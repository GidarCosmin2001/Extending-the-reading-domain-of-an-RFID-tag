The main objective of the chosen project consists in expanding the identification range of an RFID tag. 
The hardware connection part has demanded the use of components used represented by the Arduino UNO R3 development board and the reader board from SparkFun, "Simultaneous RFID Reader-M6E Nano". 
For significantly improved readability over the classic setup, an external antenna from SparkFun was integrated which was compatible with the frequency band specifications imposed by the reader. 
In addition to these components, we have attached a LCD to display the relevant steps taken in the software program, but also to recognize the IDs registered in the system, so that way this system can be used in access management. 
We have a variety of tags compatible with the reader, as they are a key factor in influencing the reading area.
The applicability of this technology based on RFID readers is vast, and it continues to develop even today. 
This type of system is often used for controlling access to institutions, and easier identification and tracking of certain objects.
